# WeatherByZipCode

This gem gives the user the current weather in either Seattle, WA or Oradell, NJ. It provides the high temperature, low temperature, and current weather conditions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'weather_by_zip_code'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install weather_by_zip_code

## Usage

After running bin/run, the user will be asked if they would like to know the weather in Seattle, WA or Oradell, NJ. They will be asked to enter 0 for Seattle, 1 for Oradell, or exit to end the gem. If they enter anything else, they will be asked again to enter 0, 1, or exit.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
